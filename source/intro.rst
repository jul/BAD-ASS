Backend Agnostic Development AsSynchronuous Site
================================================

BAD ASS is just my collections of all the trends I see in the communities in which I feel I belong (web, python, Perl) that are strongly emerging and are currently killing the jumboframeworks. 

**It is all about coding less and achieving more**

Obviously bad developers develops, good developer factorizes.

It covers as much as QA, architecture, design, coding strategies, coding convetions, conceptual integrity, protocols, security. 

If you want a design pattern name so that you can toy with it (or choke on it) call it MVCeption : A MVC in a MVC.


You know I am BAD
=================

BAD is the server side strategy. Backend agnostic refers in my head to the actual anti pattern I have seen so many time of people focusing on the storage facility (mysql, couchdb) and optimizing before even knowing their data.

 Show me your code, and I shall be mystified, show me your data and I'll know everything there is to know
   -- Fred Broks

BAD is focusing on how to semantically present data in an intuitive way, without not too much complexity, while having a good security. 

And my ASS is no chicken
========================

ASS is about front side integration with the means of asynchronuous interfaces (HTML, flash, GUI). 

It also covers front to back communication and security best practices, and some tips on using the DOM as a database. 

Finally we have got a badass here
=================================

By combining these two ideas, we can clearly see how to make front and back developpers cooperate easily. And how to be lazy.
